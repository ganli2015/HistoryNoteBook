# HistoryNoteBook
This project provide one way to organise knowledge of history.

Features:

1) One can create relationship between one history event and another.

2) One can see the tree structure around one history event and how the history goes on.

3) One can add tag to a history event for further collecting events of the same tag.

Drawbacks:

1) It is based on local database.One has to change the code referring the database.

2) One has to add history events by his own.

3) A lot of bugs perhaps.
